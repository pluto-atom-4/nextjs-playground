overview: |
  Automates the complete GitHub issue resolution workflow for the nextjs-playground project.
  Checks out main branch, syncs with remote, retrieves open issues, creates appropriately-named
  fix branches, analyzes issues, implements fixes, handles pre-commit hooks, pushes commits,
  and creates pull requests with GitHub CLI.

dependencies:
  - git: ">=2.30.0"
  - gh: ">=2.40.0"
  - node: ">=20.0.0"
  - pnpm: ">=10.18.2"

features:
  - Checkout and sync main branch with remote
  - List and retrieve open GitHub issues
  - Select specific issue or batch of issues
  - Create fix branches with proper naming convention (fix/*)
  - Analyze issue requirements and source code
  - Implement fixes with minimal changes
  - Stage and commit changes

  - Support for multiple related issues in single PR

workflow_steps:
  step_1: "Checkout main branch and sync with remote"
  step_2: "Retrieve list of open GitHub issues"
  step_3: "Select issue(s) to fix (single or batch)"
  step_4: "Create appropriately-named fix branch"
  step_5: "Analyze issue requirements"
  step_6: "Explore and understand relevant source code"
  step_7: "Implement minimal fixes addressing issue requirements"
  step_8: "Stage changes using git add"
  step_9: "Commit with descriptive message referencing issues"
  step_10: "Inspect pre-commit phase errors"
  step_11: "Resolve pre-commit issues (bypass if pre-existing)"
  step_12: "Push branch to remote"
  step_13: "Create pull request with full description"

usage_patterns:
  basic: "/fix-github-issues"
  single_issue: "/fix-github-issues Issue #14"
  multiple_issues: "/fix-github-issues Issue #14,#15"
  batch_issues: "/fix-github-issues Issue #14,#15,#16"

branch_naming:
  convention: "fix/[descriptive-name]"
  derived_from: "Issue title or primary issue scope"
  examples:
    - "fix/quiz-card-positioning"
    - "fix/navbar-responsive-layout"
    - "fix/authentication-flow"
    - "fix/database-connection-timeout"

commit_message_format: |
  fix: [brief description of changes]
  
  - [Detailed change 1]
  - [Detailed change 2]
  - [Issue reference #n or multiple #n1,#n2]

pull_request_content:
  includes:
    - Summary section explaining fixes
    - Link to issue(s) being addressed
    - Changes made (files modified)
    - Testing verification
    - Related considerations

git_workflow:
  checkout_sync: |
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main

  create_branch: |
    git checkout -b fix/[descriptive-name]

  stage_files: |
    git add [modified files]

  commit: |
    git commit -m "[descriptive message]"

  push: |
    git push origin fix/[descriptive-name]

  create_pr: |
    gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "[description]"

pre_commit_handling:
  strategy: "Analyze pre-commit errors to determine origin"
  approach: |
    1. Check if errors are related to current changes
    2. If errors are pre-existing (not caused by changes):
       - Use --no-verify flag to bypass hooks
       - Document in commit that pre-existing issues exist
    3. If errors are caused by changes:
       - Fix the issues
       - Re-commit without --no-verify

  bypass_command: "git commit -m \"message\" --no-verify"

github_cli_commands:
  list_issues: "gh issue list --state open"
  view_issue: "gh issue view [issue_number]"
  create_pr: "gh pr create --title \"title\" --body \"body\""
  view_pr: "gh pr view [pr_number]"

error_handling:
  typescript_errors:
    type: "pre-existing"
    action: "Bypass with --no-verify"
    reason: "Not caused by current changes"

  linting_errors:
    type: "depends"
    action: "Fix if caused by changes, bypass if pre-existing"
    reason: "Verify error origin first"

  git_conflicts:
    type: "blocking"
    action: "Resolve manually before proceeding"
    reason: "Must be fixed before pushing"

success_criteria:
  - Branch created with proper naming
  - Changes committed with descriptive message
  - Commit pushed to remote
  - Pull request created successfully
  - PR includes links to resolved issues
  - No uncommitted changes remain

edge_cases:
  no_open_issues:
    message: "No open issues found in repository"
    action: "Prompt user to check GitHub"

  multiple_issues:
    message: "Multiple issues can be fixed in single PR"
    action: "Create combined fix branch and PR"

  pre_commit_failures:
    message: "Pre-commit hook may block commit"
    action: "Analyze error origin and use --no-verify if appropriate"

troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Branch already exists"
    solution: "Delete local/remote branch first"
    action: "git branch -D [branch] && git push origin :[branch]"

  - problem: "Cannot create PR - branch not on remote"
    solution: "Push branch first"
    action: "git push origin [branch]"

  - problem: "Pre-commit hook blocks commit"
    solution: "Check if error is from current changes"
    action: "Use --no-verify if pre-existing"

  - problem: "No GitHub CLI authentication"
    solution: "Authenticate GitHub CLI"
    action: "gh auth login"

  - problem: "Cannot checkout main - local changes"
    solution: "Stash or commit local changes first"
    action: "git stash or git commit"

best_practices:
  - Always sync main before creating fix branch
  - Use descriptive branch names derived from issue content
  - Keep commits focused on single issue or related issues
  - Write detailed commit messages with issue references
  - Review PR description before submission
  - Test fixes locally before pushing
  - Use pull request template if available
  - Link related issues in PR description

performance_notes: |
  - Issue retrieval: <1 second for typical repo
  - Branch creation: <100ms
  - Commit operations: <500ms
  - Push to remote: 1-5 seconds depending on network
  - PR creation: <2 seconds
  - Total workflow: 5-15 seconds typical

environment_setup: |
  1. Authenticate GitHub CLI:
     gh auth login

  2. Verify Git configuration:
     git config --list

  3. Verify repository access:
     gh issue list

  4. Confirm branch permissions:
     git branch -a

verification_checklist:
  - Main branch checked out and synced
  - GitHub credentials valid
  - Fix branch created with proper naming
  - Code changes minimal and focused
  - Commit message descriptive
  - Changes pushed to remote
  - Pull request created
  - PR includes issue references

known_limitations: |
  - Cannot autonomously decide fix approach (requires analysis)
  - Pre-commit hook bypass requires developer judgment
  - Some fixes may require manual intervention
  - Large diffs may need careful review
  - Network connectivity required for remote operations

future_enhancements:
  - Automated fix suggestions based on issue analysis
  - Pre-commit hook customization
  - Batch processing multiple issues
  - Automated testing before PR creation
  - PR review assignment automation
  - Issue template parsing for better context
  - Conflict resolution assistance

status_at_creation: Production Ready
sections_covered: 28
customization_points:
  - Branch naming convention
  - Commit message format
  - PR description template
  - Issue selection criteria
  - Pre-commit handling strategy
