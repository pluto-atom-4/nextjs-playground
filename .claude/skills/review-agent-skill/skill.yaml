usage: |
  1. Prepare skill.yaml and README.md
  2. Run review agent with skill directory path
  3. Agent validates against comprehensive checklist
  4. Generates validation report (JSON/Markdown)

known_limitations: |
  - Validates structure, not implementation correctness
  - Cannot test running code
  - Generic validation (not feature-specific)
  - Requires well-formatted YAML and Markdown
  - No context about project-specific requirements

troubleshooting: |
  Problem: Validation fails on well-formed skill
  Solution: Check YAML syntax, ensure Markdown headings use proper format
  
  Problem: Report incomplete
  Solution: Verify README.md and skill.yaml files are readable and complete
  
  Problem: False positives on checks
  Solution: Review check logic, adjust criteria if feature-specific

  - Emphasizes production readiness
  - Severity-based findings
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Non-prescriptive (guides, not enforces)
  - Supports iterative improvement
